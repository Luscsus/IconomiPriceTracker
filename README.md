# About:
I quickly made this website to check on my investment. Because I'm not using my own account to invest but my brothers, therefore I needed a way to check the price without needing to constantly ask him. Here's the link to the website: https://iconomi.herokuapp.com/
# Update:
I've updated the website to support adding more investments and to calculate the daily fees.
# How it works:
It uses the https://iconomi-ag.github.io/iconomi-api/ to get the current price of the strategy i'm using (CARUS-AR), and then it calculates the percentage difference between the price at the start of the investment and the current price, to get the profit percentage. 
The website is hosted on www.heroku.com.
